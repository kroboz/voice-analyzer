Known open issues: 

* When toggling Cadence highlight on, the toggle removes spaces after the paragraph span and also adds empty paragraphs with spans
* The words-per-sentence chart built with Chart.min.js is not counting sentence length properly
* The highlight for the editor1-result / editor2-result is below the editor1/editor2 instead of appearing behind it as in earlier versions
