Known open issues: 

1. **Editor highligher** The highlight for the editor1-result / editor2-result is below the editor1/editor2 instead of appearing behind it as in earlier versions. The behavior should match https://hemingwayapp.com/, and the code for this editor is based on https://writinganalyzer.appspot.com/
2. **Words/sentence chart** The chart showing the number of words per sentence is built with Chart.min.js and is meant to show, in a horizontal bar chart, the number of words in each sentence similar to https://capture.dropbox.com/g2ZlIbP4xpjFcDlr However, the chart is counting the number of words per sentence incorrectly and showing incorrect results. Ideally the resulting chart should show a bar chart like the screenshot from prowritingaid.com (paid service, but longer screenshot here https://capture.dropbox.com/KDHsos3LvYXdbKyf)
3. **Cadence visualizer** The Cadence button is meant to toggle a highlight that adds a background color to sentences in an alternating yellow-blue pattern. This is meant to easily compare average sentence lengths (ie, long long short, long short long, etc.). The button should toggle this highlight on and off. However, when toggling Cadence highlight on, the toggle removes spaces after the paragraph span and also adds empty paragraphs with spans.
