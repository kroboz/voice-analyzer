Known open issues: 

1. The highlight for the editor1-result / editor2-result is below the editor1/editor2 instead of appearing behind it as in earlier versions. The behavior should match https://hemingwayapp.com/, and the code for this editor is based on https://writinganalyzer.appspot.com/
2. The words-per-sentence chart built with Chart.min.js is not counting sentence length properly. It should produce a result similar to https://capture.dropbox.com/g2ZlIbP4xpjFcDlr
3. The Cadence button is meant to toggle a highlight that adds a background color to sentences in an alternating yellow-blue pattern. This is meant to easily compare average sentence lengths (ie, long long short, long short long, etc.). The button should toggle this highlight on and off. However, when toggling Cadence highlight on, the toggle removes spaces after the paragraph span and also adds empty paragraphs with spans.
